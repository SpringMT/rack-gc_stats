# Rack::GCStats [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SpringMT/rack-gc_stats.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SpringMT/rack-gc_stats)

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/rack/gc_stat`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rack-gc_stats'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rack-gc_stats

## Usage

### Rackup files

```
# In config.ru
use Rack::GCStats, scoreboard_path: './tmp', enabled: true
```

### Get GC Stats under Ruby 2.3.1

Launch the rack server using 8080 port with Rack::GCStats.

Then access gc_stats path(default: /gc_stats).

When add `?json` query parameter, return JSON formatted response.

```
% curl -s localhost:8080/gc_stats?json | jq .
{
  "stats": [
    {
      "count": 30,

  ]
}
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
